# Stubz-client
Welcome to the client-side for the web application Stubz. This application allows users to connect to its database by interacting with its visual interface. Through this interaction, users can login and/or create an account; update user information; and, ultimately, search through movies, genres, and directors. Users can also add/remove movies to their Favorites list. User account information as well as information about the featured movies, genres, and directors are stored in and pulled from a MongoDB database by way of Stubz API, a Node application.
